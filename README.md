# Genre-Detection-Of-Bengali-Songs-Based-On-Audio-Data
**Genre Detection of Bengali Rabindranath Tagore's Song Based On Audio Data. The dataset of songs was provided by [Society For Natural Language Technology Research](https://nltr.org/)**


**_I'm not providing the dataset due to privacy issues._**

I extracted the audio features using Python [Librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) Library.


###### Install Librosa

`pip install librosa`

I used LSTM and simple Deep Learning Based Approach to train the model.
